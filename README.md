# Rails Engine - Turing Module 3 Solo Project

## Project Description

You are working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. Your job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.

### Rails Driver

**[Rails Driver](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver) is the front end of the application**. It includes a test suite as well as a front end to test your application. Instructors will use this to determine the completion of your project.

It should be noted that in most professional applications, the front end would not be written in Rails. More likely, a pure front end application would use a Javascript framework such as React. However, in order to make this portion of the project more understandable to BEM3 students we have written it in Rails. The extensions for this project will build on this front end application.
